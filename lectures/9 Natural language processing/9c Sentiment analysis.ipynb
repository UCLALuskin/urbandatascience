    "In its simplest form, sentiment analysis works through applying a corpus of words and phrases that indicate sentiment. [SentiWordNet](https://github.com/aesuli/SentiWordNet) is a commonly used corpus—[look at the list here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aesuli/SentiWordNet/master/data/SentiWordNet_3.0.0.txt). For example, \"worst,\" \"terrible,\" and \"apprehensive\" have negative scores, while \"feel_like_a_million_dollars\" has a positive score. Some words have both positive and negative scores. Some algorithms consider the part of speech in which the word occurs (e.g. is it an adjective or noun).\n",
