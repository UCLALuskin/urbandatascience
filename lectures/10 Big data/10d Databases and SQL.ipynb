    "## Why use a database\n",
    "In most cases, Python in general, and `pandas`/`geopandas` in particular, will do an excellent job for your data science workflow. But sometimes, they might not be the best option. Here are some situations when you might want to consider a database.\n",
    "* Your dataset won't fit in memory\n",
    "* Multiple users need access at the same time\n",
    "* You need to validate and maintain the integrity of the data through access controls and transactions (a transaction means that if the computer crashes halfway through, your data integrity is unaffected)\n",
    "\n",
    "Many planning agencies have databases already hosted on the agency's server, for example to store land-use permits or GIS files. Some of these might be spatial databases, e.g. with ESRI's ArcGIS suite. You might need to query these as part of your work.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also set up your own database, even on a laptop. External hard drives are pretty cheap. Of course, if you want someone else to access it, an always-on computer with a stable internet connection is needed. But this could even be an old computer that you keep in the corner of the office or lab.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key takeaway:** Data that needs to be preserved and maintained, whether permit issuance, rider surveys, or asset inventories such as bus stops, shouldn't be an Excel file on someone's computer. What happens if they retire or their computer gets stolen? Or someone inadvertently \"corrects\" the data and introduces errors? Or different users have different versions of the Excel file on their computers?"

    "## How to set up a database\n",
    "I highly recommend PostgreSQL (Postgres for short). It's free, open-source, and cross-platform (runs on Windows, Mac, and Linux.) It is well supported and updated, and has incredible spatial analysis capabilities through the [PostGIS](http://postgis.net) extension.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most databases use the same language — SQL, which stands for Structured Query Language. So if you learn Postgres, you should be able to use pretty much any alternative with minimal hassle.\n",
    "\n",
    "Installing Postgres is simple. We won't need to do it for this class. But if you feel inclined to experiment, [the PostGIS site provides a list of downloadable versions](http://postgis.net/install/). For Mac, I recommend postgres.app to get started, as it works just like any Mac app, and the Homebrew version for more advanced users.\n",
    "\n",
    "You don't need any sort of fancy computer to download and run Postgres. If you have large datasets or intensive computations, almost any cloud provider (e.g. AWS) lets you run Postgres. But for most purposes, a standard laptop or desktop computer will work well."
