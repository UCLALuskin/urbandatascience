    "## Stats in Python\n",
    "Some brief notes and examples on how to do statistical analysis in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "We saw a bit of this in the machine learning module, comparing logistic regression to random forests. Some of the statistical functions are built into `scikit-learn`. But `statsmodels` has more features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why use `statsmodels`?\n",
    "- it integrates nicely with `pandas`, so if you have data wrangling code and are joining together lots of datasets, `statsmodels` can simplify your analysis workflow\n",
    "- if you are familiar with R, the syntax is almost identical. [See examples here](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/index.html).\n",
    "- the geospatial functionality is much better in Python than in R, and so any GIS+regression analysis might be better off in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why use R or Stata instead?\n",
    "- maybe you or your collaborators are more proficient in R (or Stata)\n",
    "- you are using more advanced statistical models that are not supported in Python (or would require a lot of custom matrix algebra) - especially true for causal inference, clustered standard errors, and Bayesian analysis, but that is changing fast\n",
    "- R and Stata have more advanced postestimation commands (e.g. marginal effects)\n",
    "- there are more online examples for R and Stata\n",
    "\n",
    "In these cases, you can still use Python for data wrangling, web scraping, etc. But you then save a `.csv` file that you load in to R. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can also call R functions from Python! Check out `rpy2`: https://rpy2.github.io\n",
    "\n",
    "TL;DR: for most projects, it won't make a difference - do whatever is easier."
